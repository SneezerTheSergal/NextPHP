# MyProgrammingLang
this is a WIP, i'm trying to make a programming language with PHP, using: https://craftinginterpreters.com/

- First thing i need to make clear in this project: cls is just the prefix i use for my PHP classes, many people seem to to think it's something special, while it is only a way of naming things lol.
- even though this is a "very way too early access" thing, i already want to thank some people:
  - Thanks to all people from the fireship discord server, y'all inspired me to do this :D
  - Thanks to my boyfriend, for being great mental support (i will need it lol)
  - Thanks to Fourthedev, for helping me out whenever i encounter problems of which i don't know how to fix them
